introduction: |
  Welcome to the Siemens MindSphere Integration Tutorial! This blueprint demonstrates how to connect a Particle device to Siemens MindSphere, enabling real-time data transfer using the Timeseries REST API. In this tutorial, you’ll configure a Particle webhook to send temperature data from a Particle device to MindSphere, where the data can be securely stored, visualized, and analyzed.

  Every 10 seconds, the Particle device captures temperature readings and publishes this data to MindSphere via the webhook. MindSphere then stores this data in its time-series database, allowing you to view historical trends and generate insights for applications like equipment monitoring and environmental analysis.
