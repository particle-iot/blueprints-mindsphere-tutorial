  This Siemens MindSphere Integration Tutorial demonstrates how to send environmental data from a Particle device
  to Siemens MindSphere using the Timeseries REST API. It walks through configuring a webhook to send temperature
  data from a Particle device to MindSphere, where data can be stored, visualized, and analyzed.

  Key Topics:
  - Configuring Particle Webhooks for MindSphere
  - Using the MindSphere Timeseries API
  - Managing secure access to MindSphere using Vault
